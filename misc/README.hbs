Reference implementation of:
 
    FTN12: FutoIn Async API
    Version: 1.2
    
Spec: [FTN12: FutoIn Async API v1.x](http://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn12_async_api-1.html)

[Web Site](http://futoin.org/)


# About

Adds classical linear program flow structure to async programming
supporting exceptions. error handlers, timeouts, unlimited number of sub-steps,
execution parallelism and job state/context variables.

Current version is targeted at Node.js, but should be easily used in
web browser environment as well [not yet tested].

It should be possible to use any other async framework from AsyncSteps by using
setCancel() and/or setTimeout() methods which allow step completion without success() or
error() result. Specific step-associated AsyncSteps interface will be valid for success() or error()
call on external event.

It also possible to use FutoIn AsyncSteps from any other event framework. Just make sure to notify
external framework from the top most error handler (for errors) and last step (for success).

To minimize cost of closure creation on repetitive execution, a special feature of "model" step
is available: model step is created as usual, but must never get executed. It possible to copy steps
and state variables using AsyncSteps#copyFrom() to a newly created object.
